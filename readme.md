# Automata

A web app that renders one-dimensional cellular automata, according to [Wolfram's rules](http://atlas.wolfram.com/01/01/).

- Inspired by the first [38 minutes of FunFunFunction \#49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc-fVdbjAwk).
- Conceptual help for understanding the rules from [The Nature of Code's chapter on cellular automata](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/).
- See `data/readme.md` for info about creating an object of all 256 rule sets.

Todo:
- create UI to select which ruleset to render, and color palette
- render automata inside a div smaller than the viewport
- get js to work across browsers
